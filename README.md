# WhenAreYouFree
Easily see when I'm free.

Enter a date/time on a webfront-end and see if I am free at that time. Might include a Â±10minute buffer between events so as not to cause any undue overlap.

Probably going to start it in NodeJS because beautiful blend b/w frontend and backend development.
